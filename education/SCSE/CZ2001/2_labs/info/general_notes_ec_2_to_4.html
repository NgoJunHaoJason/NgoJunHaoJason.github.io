        <h3>Example Classes - General Notes for Example Classes 2 - 4</h3>

        <p>
            The next three example classes intend to reinforce your understanding of
            algorithms through hands-on experience of implementation and empirical
            analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before an example class, each group should have finished the coding and testing
            of programs (in Java, C or C++) on your own computers, and have written a
            report describing the implementation and experiments. The first 30 minutes of the
            example class may be used to test and finalize the programs and presentation
            materials. Then, representatives are chosen by each group to give a demo of
            their program and experimental results. By the end of the example class, each
            group should submit to lab tutor:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    the project report (in softcopy or hardcopy);
                </li>

                <li>
                    source code, executable and testing data (in softcopy).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            Each member of the group should know the program and presentation materials
            well enough to be able to act as a backup presenter or to help answer questions
            in the class. Thus, for example, if someone is not feeling well, someone else
            should be able to step forward and do the presentation as a substitute. Otherwise,
            the performance of the group will suffer and therefore the grade.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Make sure that each presentation is limited to <b>10 minutes</b>. Having too
                    many PowerPoint slides is not encouraged.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Write your report concisely. Each report should be <b>at most 5 pages</b> long.
                </li>
            </ul>
