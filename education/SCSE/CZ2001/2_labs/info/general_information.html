        <h3>Example Classes - General Information</h3>
        <p>
            The main purpose of example classes is to reinforce students’ learning of algorithmic concepts
            and techniques by hands-on exercises. Moreover, the example classes can train the practical
            skills in implementation, empirical analysis and presentation of algorithms. The performance of
            a student in the example classes will constitute <b>20%</b> of his/her final mark for the course.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Timeline</u>
        </p>

        <p>
            There are four example classes:
            <ol>
                <li>Example Class 1: Week 4 – 5</li>
                <li>Example Class 2: Week 6 – 7</li>
                <li>Example Class 3: Week 9 – 10</li>
                <li>Example Class 4: Week 11 – 12</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            In case of time clash (such as with public holidays), the tutor and students can schedule a
            convenient time slot for make-up.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Group projects</u>
        </p>

        <p>
            Students will be allocated into groups each of 5 – 7 members. To nurture cultural intelligence,
            we encourage grouping in such a way that each group will have students from at least two
            nationalities. <i>Students are to form groups by themselves and finalize the grouping within the first
                20 minutes of Example Class 1.</i> After that, no swap across groups will be allowed unless
            absolutely necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Example Class 1, each group will perform theoretical complexity analysis for algorithms, and
            give a presentation in the class.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Example Classes 2 – 4, students will implement algorithms using a language of their own
            choice (e.g. Java, C or C++), and test programs on input data. Depending on specific
            requirements of classes, the dataset may be generated by students themselves or downloaded
            from the web. In the presentation, a group should give a demo of the program running on the
            input data.
        </p>

        <p>
            By the end of each class (except for Example Class 1), a group should submit to tutor:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Softcopy of source code, compiled executables and test data;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hardcopy or softcopy of report summarizing the implementation and experimental results.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            Note: On each computer in the laboratory, compilers and IDEs (e.g. Java JDK 7, NetBeans
            7.3.1) have been installed. You may also use your own laptop. Please test your program in the
            lab before giving a demo.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Presentation or program demo</u>
        </p>

        <p>
            In each session, every group should choose 2 – 3 students to take part in the presentation,
            which includes a computer demo of algorithm implementation. The 2 – 3 students representing
            their group should divide the presentation material equally. Every student should take part in the
            preparation of the presentation material. Throughout the 4 example classes, every student
            should take part in at least <u><b>two</b></u> presentations. Tutors will record the names of students who
            do
            the presentation for each session.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each group must finish coding and preparing a presentation before the class. However, the first
            30 – 40 minutes of each example class will be given to the students to finalize presentation
            materials or to test their programs on the computers. Each group has <b>10 minutes</b> for giving a
            presentation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Facilities for PowerPoint presentation are provided by the laboratory.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                Plagiarism is strictly prohibited. If the program or report of a group is found to have a
                similarity of more than 50% with another group or web materials, all members of the
                group will receive zero mark for the example class. Further academic disciplinary actions
                may be taken.
            </b>
