        <h3>Example Classes - Scoring Scheme</h3>

        <p>
            The example classes will constitute 20% of the final marks of this course. Each of
            the 4 Example Classes will carry equal marks, that is, 5% of the final marks.
        </p>

        <p>
            In general, all members of the same group will be given the same grade for each
            example class. <b>However, the tutor can award a student with outstanding
                performance a higher grade than the group grade, if he/she finds it justified.
                On the other hand, if a student makes little contribution to the group (such
                as, not actively participating in the project, coming late or leaving class
                early without valid justification), the tutor can deduct his/her marks.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Example Class 1</b>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Content of presentation (60%):</b> Correctness and completeness of the answer.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Presentation skills (30%):</b> Clarity in explanation and English speaking, show confidence in
                    the presentation and answering questions.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Cooperation/participation among the group members (10%):</b> Group members have active
                    discussions in the first 30 – 40 minutes; when a presenter cannot answer a question raised, another
                    group member help answer it.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Note on absence</u>: A student absent for this class must obtain approval of the lab
            tutor in advance. He/she should provide a medical certificate (MC) or other
            evidence to justify the leave of abscence. Moreover, the student must submit a
            hand-written solution to a question that is not the one done by his/her group
            mates, <i>within <b>three days</b> of the last day of the medical certificate or leave of
                absence</i>. Otherwise, the absent student will get zero mark for this class.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Example Classes 2 – 4</b>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Report and code (60%):</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Understanding of the problem and algorithm (20%);
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Implementation of algorithm, quality and performance of code (20%);
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Design and analysis of experiments on real and/or synthetic data (20%).
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Presentation/Demo (30%):</b> The Java, C or C++ code must compile and run
                    successfully; clarity in explanation and English speaking; organize the demo with
                    a clear flow of information; show confidence in the presentation and answering
                    questions.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Cooperation/participation of the group members (10%):</b> Every group
                    member should contribute to the coding and writing of project report. The
                    cooperation for the demo will be judged similarly as in Example Class 1.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Note on late submission</u>: Each group should submit the report and code to lab
            tutor before the end of the example class. If the report and code are submitted n
            days after the due date, the mark will be deducted by n*20%. For example,
            suppose a group receives 80 marks (out of 100) for an example class, but
            because they submitted the report one day late, the deduction will be 80*20% =
            16 marks, hence the final mark for this group will be 80 – 16 = 64. If the delay is
            longer than 5 days, the group will receive zero mark for the example class.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Note on absence</u>: Every student should be present at the demo, even if the report
            and source have been submitted. For leave of abscence, a student should
            provide valid document for justification, such as medical certificate (MC) to obtain
            the approval of lab tutor <i><b>before</b></i> the example class. Moreover, the absent student
            should submit to lab tutor a reflection report describing his/her contributions to the
            group project <i>within <b>three days</b> of the last day of the medical certificate or leave
                of absence</i>. The contributions should be verified by his/her group mates via
            emails. Otherwise, the absent student will get zero mark for this class.
