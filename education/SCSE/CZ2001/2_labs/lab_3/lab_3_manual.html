        <h3>Example Class 3 (Week 9 - Week 10)</h3>

        <p>
            Please choose <b>one</b> of the following two projects (Project 3A or 3B):
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>
                Project 3A: Empirical comparison between Insertion Sort and
                Mergesort
            </u>
        </p>

        <p>
            The objective of this project is to perform empirical comparison of time efficiency
            between the two sorting algorithms, namely Insertion Sort and Mergesort. For
            simplicity, suppose the input data are arrays of integers and the algorithms
            should sort the integers into ascending order.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this project, the following steps need to be carried out:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Algorithm implementation:</b> Implement the algorithms of Insertion Sort and
                    Mergesort in the same programming language (after choosing one from Java,
                    C or C++). For Mergesort, in order to achieve high speed, you can use an
                    auxiliary array to store the result of merging.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Generating input data:</b> Generate arrays of increasing sizes, say in a range
                    from 1000 to 1 million. For each of the sizes, generate the following types of
                    data:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Randomly generated datasets of integers in the range [1 ... n].
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Integers 1, 2, ..., n sorted in ascending order.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Integers n, nâˆ’1, ...,1 sorted in descending order.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Measuring time complexity:</b> Run your programs of the two sorting
                    algorithms on the datasets generated in Step 2. Count the numbers of key
                    comparisons (i.e. comparisons between array elements), and record the CPU
                    times. The statistical results (i.e. numbers of key comparisons and CPU times)
                    should be recorded into a table.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Analysis of results:</b> Draw scatter plots to visualize the running times of the
                    two algorithms on the different types of data (i.e. integers in random,
                    ascending, and descending orders). The variable on x-axis is the size of the
                    input array, and the variable on y-axis is the running time. In each plot, show
                    how the running time increases with the input size. Compare your empirical
                    results with theoretical analysis of time complexity.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            In your report and presentation, please describe the above steps, as well as
            results.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Project 3B: Integration of Mergesort and Insertion Sort</u>
        </p>

        <p>
            As a divide-and-conquer algorithm, Mergesort breaks the input array into sub-
            arrays and recursively sorts them. When the sizes of sub-arrays are small, the
            overhead of many recursive calls makes the algorithm inefficient. This problem
            can be remedied by choosing a small value of <b>S</b> as a threshold for the size of
            sub-arrays. When the size of a sub-array in a recursive call is less than or equal
            to the value of <b>S</b>, the algorithm will switch to Insertion sort, which is efficient for
            small input. A pseudocode of the modified Mergesort is given below:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/NgoJunHaoJason/2d58600e712099339081e2f120d2b5f6.js"></script>

        <p>
            Implement the original version of Mergesort (as learned in lecture) and the above
            modified version of Mergesort, using a programming language of your choice (e.g.
            Java, C or C++). Compare their performances in the numbers of key
            comparisons and CPU times. The value of <b>S</b> is to be empirically decided by trial
            and error.
        </p>

        <p>
            For simplicity, suppose the input elements are integers and the goal is to sort
            input numbers in ascending order. Your report and presentation should include a
            description and results of the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Generate your own input data sets of various sizes, say, ranging from
                    1000 to 1,000,000 random integers.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Count the numbers of key comparisons and CPU times taken by your
                    program on the data sets. Describe how running times increase with input
                    sizes when running the two versions of Mergesort algorithm.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Carry out experiments to study how the different values of <b>S</b> will affect the
                    performance of the modified algorithm.
                </li>
            </ol>
