        <p>
            <u>
                Applications and Empirical Analysis of Searching Algorithms
            </u>
        </p>

        <p>
            Study and identify an example application, where hashing algorithms are used in the
            process to solve a real world problem. For example, the problem can be storing and
            searching of employee information based on NRIC numbers, storing and searching of
            vehicle information in a taxi company based on car plate registration numbers, storing
            and searching of book information in a library, or storing and searching of product
            information in a warehouse. If real world data sets are not available, you may generate
            synthetic data sets for use in your experiments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Implement the algorithms of hashing using a programming language of your choice (e.g.
            Java, C, or C++). Each group should have implementation and comparative experiments
            of at least <b>two variations of the hashing methods</b>, as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Using closed address hashing, compare between different hashing functions
                    (Group 1).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Using closed address hashing, compare between hash tables of prime and non-
                    prime sizes (Group 2).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Using open address hashing and linear probing, compare between different
                    hashing functions (Group 3).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Using open address hashing and double hashing, compare between different
                    rehashing functions (Group 4).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Using open address hashing, compare between linear probing and double
                    hashing (Group 5).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Using the same hashing function and table size, compare between closed and
                    open address hashing (Group 6).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            Your programs should report the <b>average CPU time</b> as well as the <b>average number of
                key comparisons</b> for searching in the hash tables using the chosen methods. Note that
            you may need to use data with a specific distribution (e.g. all data items are multiples of
            some values) to contrast the performance of different hashing methods under various
            circumstances.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your presentation and report should include
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Description of the problem scenario and the selected data set;
                </li>

                <li>
                    Description of your chosen hashing algorithms;
                </li>

                <li>
                    Demo of your implementation of hashing algorithms to search for an entity in the
                    data set, including searches for both successful and unsuccessful cases;
                </li>

                <li>
                    Statistics on the average CPU time and the number of key comparisons taken to
                    search in data sets with various load factors (e.g. 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75). Be sure
                    you repeat the searches sufficiently many times so that the performance figures
                    are stable and report statistics for both successful and unsuccessful cases;
                </li>

                <li>
                    Explanation of the results obtained and conclusion on time complexity comparison
                    between your chosen variants of hashing algorithms.
                </li>
            </ol>
