            Algorithm Analysis
        </h3>

        <h4>What is it?</h4>
        <p>
            We analyse algorithms to quantify their resource consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be more specific, we do asymptotic algorithm analysis: study of
            the resources used by an algorithm when
            the problem becomes larger and larger without bound.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do so, we need comparison criteria or measures.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this course, we measure algorithms' efficiency in terms of time
            and space taken.
        </p>

        <h4>So how do we do it?</h4>
        <p>
            A naive approach is to do empirical comparison, where you actually
            run the programs and measure the time
            taken to run them.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there are several problems with doing an empirical
            comparison:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It is difficult to do it 'fairly'.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            When you run a program on a machine, other factors
                            come into play.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For example, different CPUs may have different clock
                            speed and take different amount of time
                            to run programs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In addition, otther programs that are running in the
                            background would require the CPU and
                            contribute to the time taken.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Also, during the first run of a program, some values
                            are accessed for the first time and for
                            subsequent runs, they are readily available in the
                            cache, resulting in inconsistent time
                            taken.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Execution time is not the right measure of time efficiency.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In order to run the program, you have to enter data
                            of known, finite problem size. However,
                            for asymptotic analysis, there is supposedly no
                            upper bound on problem - it can get as large
                            as possible.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Points regarding fairness of empirical comparisons
                            applies here as well.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is time consuming to perform empirical comparisons.
                    <ul>
                        The problem size is typically huge, which means a lot of
                        time is taken to process the data.
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The smarter way of measuring efficiency is to derive the time and
            space complexity of the algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
            To measure time complexity (amount of time used), we:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Count the number of primitive operations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Determine the major parameters that affect the problem (i.e.
                    problem size).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Derive an equation that relates the parameters to the number
                    of primitive operations that the
                    algorithm does.
                </li>
            </ol>
            This is related to algorithmic aspects.
        </p>
        <p>
            To measure space complexity (amount of space used), we:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Count the number of storage units required. (e.g. memory
                    used - 1 int &rightarrow; 4 bytes for
                    instance)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Determine the major parameters that affect the
                    problem (problem size).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Derive an equation that relates the parameters to the number
                    of storage units that the algorithm
                    uses.
                </li>
            </ol>
            This is related to data structures.

        <h4>Some Terminologies</h4>
        <p>
            problem size
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The problem size depends on the problem being studied (e.g.
                    the number of items to be sorted).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Usually, the number of primitive operations done by an
                    algorithm is a function of the problem size.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            primitive operation
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A basic step that can be performed in constant time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Assignment (e.g. x = 1)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Comparisons (==, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=)
                        </li>

        <p>
            programming constructs
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A composite collection of basic steps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            loops (for, while)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            branching (if-else, switch-case)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            functions (recursive vs non-recursive)
                        </li>
