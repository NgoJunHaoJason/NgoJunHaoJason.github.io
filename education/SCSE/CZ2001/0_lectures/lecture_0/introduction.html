            Introduction
        </h3>

        <p>
            An algorithm is a clearly specified set of simple instructions to be
            followed
            to solve a problem or compute a function.
        </p>

        <p>
            A good algorithm possesses the following properties:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    It must be correct - it always returns the correct results.
                </li>

                <li>
                    It must be composed of a series of concrete steps. There can
                    be no ambiguity as to which step will be performed next.
                </li>

                <li>
                    It must be composed of a finite number of steps - it must
                    terminate.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>

            At the heart of computer program design, there are two
            (sometimes conflicting) goals:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    To design an algorithm that is easy to understand, code
                    and debug, which can be achieved through software
                    engineering.
                </li>

                <li>
                    To design an algorithm that makes efficient use of the
                    computer's resources, which can be achieved through data
                    structures and algorithm analysis
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            This course focuses on the most efficient algorithms - ones that
            uses the least amount of resources.
