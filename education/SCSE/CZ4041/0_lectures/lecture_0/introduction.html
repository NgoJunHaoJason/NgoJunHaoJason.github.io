            Introduction
        </h3>

        <h4>What is machine learning?</h4>

        <p>
            Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs
            that can teach themselves to grow from data and change when exposed
            to new data.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is motivated by how human beings learn from examples, experience
            or exercise.
        </p>

        <h4>Motivating example</h4>

        <p>
            Given an image of a person's face, classify the person's sex.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the past, to develop AI system to solve such a task, developers
            or domain experts need to provide rules (if-then) and implement them
            in the system.
        </p>

        <p>
            example rules:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the person's face has long hair and does not have
                    moustache, then the person is female.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If the person has short hair and a moustache, then the
                    person is male.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            limitations:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    time consuming - have to define rules for each domain
                </li>

                <li>
                    the defined rules may be incomplete - cannot handle case
                    where face has long hair and moustache.
                </li>

                <li>
                    unable to handle uncertainty - in real world, outcome is
                    usually based on probability, so a lot of cases cannot be
                    handled
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            How about letting the machine learn the rules by itself?

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The computer is presented with example inputs and their
                    desired outputs, given by human.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The goal is to learn a general rule (or model) that maps
                    inputs to outputs.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>definition of machine learning</h4>

        <p>
            Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that provides
            computers with the ability to learn from examples or experience
            without being explicitly programmed.
        </p>

        <h4>how to represent an example</h4>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    feature engineering (not the focus of machine learning)
                </li>

                <li>
                    representation learning (one of the crucial research topics
                    in machine) - deep learning is currently the most effective
                    form of representation learning
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>relationship between machine learning and related keywords</h4>

        <p>
            Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence - there are
            many other fields of artificial intelligence.
        </p>

        <p>
            Deep learning is a methodology of machine learning - there are many
            other methodologies in machine learning.
        </p>

        <p>
            Machine learning has become the primary mechanism for data analytics
            (which is key in data science).
        </p>

        <p>
            Nowadays, machine learning is more interdisciplinary:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    distributed / parallel computing + machine learning
                    &rightarrow; distributed / parallel machine learning
                </li>

                <li>
                    machine learning + hardware &rightarrow; neural processors
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>machine learning paradigms</h4>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    supervised learning
                </li>

                <li>
                    unsupervised learning
                </li>

                <li>
                    reinforcement learning
                </li>

                <li>
                    advanced paradigms:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            semi-supervised learning
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            active learning
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            transfer learning
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>supervised learning</h4>

        <p>
            The examples presented to computers are pairs of inputs and
            corresponding outputs (labelled training data). The goal is to learn
            a mapping or model from inputs to labels.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    outputs are discrete values &rightarrow; classification
                </li>

                <li>
                    outputs are continuous values &rightarrow; regression
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>unsupervised learning</h4>

        <p>
            The examples presented to computers are a set of inputs without any outputs. The goal is to learn an intrinsic structure of the examples (e.g. clusters of the examples, density of the examples).
        </p>

        <h4>reinforcement learning</h4>

        <p>
            An agent learn by interacting with an environment to achieve a goal. The objective is to learn an optimal policy mapping states to actions.
        </p>

        <h4>semi-supervised learning</h4>

        <p>
            The examples presented to computers include both labelled data and unlabelled data. The goal is to us unlabelled data to aid supervised learning.
        </p>

        <h4>active learning</h4>

        <p>
            The examples presented to the computer are unlabelled. The active learner (computer) may pose queries in the form of unlabelled examples to be labelled by an oracle (human annotator) with cost.
        </p>

        <h4>transfer learning</h4>
