        <h3>Example Class 4 (Week 11 – Week 12)</h3>

        <p>
            Please choose <b>one</b> of the following two projects (Project 4A or 4B):
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>
                Project 4A: Statistical and topological analysis of social networks
            </u>
        </p>

        <p>
            Write a program (in Java, C or C++) to analyze the statistical properties of a social network. For a node in
            a network (or graph), its <i>degree</i> is the number of other nodes connected with it. In this project, we
            will calculate and analyze the distribution of node degrees for a graph <i>G</i> that represents a social
            network, to see if <i>G</i> represents a “scale-free” network.
        </p>

        <p>
            The following definition of "scale-free network" is from Wikipedia, and it is used in
            this project:
        </p>

        <p>
            "A scale-free network is a network whose degree distribution follows a power law, at least asymptotically.
            That is, the fraction <i>P(k)</i> of nodes in the network having <i>k</i> connections to other nodes goes
            for large values of <i>k</i> as <i>P(k) &prop; k<sup>-&gamma;</sup></i>, where <i>&gamma;</i> is a parameter
            whose value is typically in the range 2 &lt; <i>&gamma;</i> &lt; 3 , although occasionally it may lie
            outside these bounds."
        </p>

        <p>
            The project can be divided into the following steps:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Retrieve a real social network dataset of big size:</b> You may use APIs of
                    some publicly available social networks. For example:

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/">
                                Facebook
                            </a>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api">
                                Twitter
                            </a>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/api/rest/latest/">
                                Google+
                            </a>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    Also, you can choose a social network from <a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data/">SNAP</a>.
                    <br>
                    A recommended network size is around 5000 nodes. But you may also
                    choose other network sizes. Use either an adjacency matrix or an array of
                    adjacency lists to represent the network.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Calculate node degrees:</b> Design and implement an algorithm to calculate the
                    degrees of all the nodes in the network.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Study the distribution of node degrees:</b> Plot a histogram for the node degrees in your
                    network, where the variable on x-axis is <i>k</i> (i.e. the node degree), and the variable on y-axis
                    is <i>P(k)</i> (i.e. the fraction of nodes having degree equal to <i>k</i>). Do curve fitting (e.g.
                    using Microsoft Excel or R) of the power-law function to the data, choosing a value for &gamma; that
                    fits the data well.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            In your report and presentation, please describe the above steps and results.
        </p>

                Project 4B: Application of BFS to flight scheduling
            </u>
        </p>

        <p>
            Construct an undirected graph to represent non-stop airline flights between cities in the world (a
            <u>hypothetical</u> graph for Asia Pacific is given below). In your graph, please add more cities and
            flights to make it more realistic. It should contain at least one pair of cities, between which there is no
            non-stop flight, but there is a route (or path) between them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Implement the Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm (using Java or C/C++) to find a route between two cities
            with the minimum number of stops. That is, when user inputs the names of two cities, your program should
            return <b>one</b> route with the smallest possible number of stop(s). If a non-stop flight is available, it
            will just return the departure city and arrival city.
        </p>

        <p>
            In your report and presentation, please include a description and results of the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Measure the CPU times of your program on graphs of different sizes, and analyze how the running
                    times depend on the numbers of cities and non-stop flights.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Explain whether Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm can be used in place of BFS, why or why not.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
