            Why Agents?
        </h3>

        <h4>trends</h4>

        <p>
            5 ongoing trends (increasing) have marked the history of computing:

            <ul>
                <li>ubiquity</li>
                <li>interconnection</li>
                <li>intelligence</li>
                <li>delegation</li>
                <li>human-orientation</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>ubiquity (pervasiveness)</h4>

        <p>
            The continual reduction in cost of computing capability has made it
            possible to introduce processing power into places and devices that
            would have once been uneconomic.
        </p>

        <p>
            As processing capability spreads, sophistication (and intelligence
            of sort) becomes ubiquitous.
        </p>

        <h4>interconnection</h4>

        <p>
            Computer systems today no longer stand alone, but are networked into
            large distributed systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since distributed and concurrent systems have become the norm, some
            researchers are putting forward theoretical models that portray
            computing as primarily a process of interaction.
        </p>

        <h4>intelligence</h4>

        <p>
            The complexity of tasks that we are capable of automating and
            delegating to computers has grown steadily.
        </p>

        <h4>delegation</h4>

        <p>
            Computers are doing more for us - without our intervention (ties in
            with intelligence).
        </p>

        <p>
            We are giving control to computers, even in safety critical tasks.
        </p>

        <h4>human-orientation</h4>

        <p>
            We are moving away from machine-oriented views of programming,
            towards concepts and metaphors that more closely reflect the way we
            ourselves understand the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            Programmers (and users) relate to machines differently.
        </p>

        <p>
            Programmers conceptualise and implement software in terms of
            higher-level (more human-oriented) abstractions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Programming has passed through:

            <ul>
                <li>machine code</li>
                <li>assembly language</li>
                <li>machine-independent programming languages</li>
                <li>subroutines</li>
                <li>procedures and functions</li>
                <li>abstract data types</li>
                <li>objects</li>
            </ul>

            to agents.
        </p>

        <h4>implications</h4>

        <p>
            Delegation and intelligence imply the need to build computer systems
            that can act effectively on our behalf.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Computer systems need to act independently.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Computer systems need to act in a way that represents our
                    best interests while interacting with other humans or
                    systems.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Interconnection and distribution have become core motifs in computer
            science.
        </p>

        <p>
            Interconnection and distribution, coupled with the need for systems
            to represent our best interests, implies that systems should
            cooperate and reach agreements (or even compete) with other systems
            that have different interests, much as we do with people.
        </p>

        <p>
            These issues were not studied in computer science until recently.
        </p>

        <p>
            All of these trends have led to the emergence of a new field in
            computer science: multi-agent systems.
        </p>

        <h4>agents</h4>

        <p>
            definitions:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    An agent is a computer system that is capable of independent
                    action on behalf of its user or owner - it figures out what
                    need to be done to satisfy designated objectives, rather
                    than constantly being told.
                </li>

                <li>
                    An agent is a computer system that is situated in some
                    environment, and is capable of taking autonomous action in
                    the environment to meet its delegated objectives.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            There is a lack of standardised definition - agent means many things
            to many people.
        </p>

        <h4>multi-agent systems</h4>

        <p>
            A multi-agent system is one that consists of a number of agents,
            which interact with one another.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the most general use case, agents will be acting on behalf of
            users with different goals and motivations
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to successfully interact, they require the ability to
            cooperate, coordinate and negotiate with each other, just like
            people.
        </p>

        <p>
            This course covers 2 key problems:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    (single) agent design - How do we build agents capable of
                    independent, autonomous action, so that they can
                    successfully carry out tasks that we delegate to them?
                </li>

                <li>
                    society design - How do we build agents that are capable of
                    interacting (cooperating, coordinating, negotiating) with
                    other agents in order to successfully carry out those
                    delegated tasks, especially when the other agents cannot be
                    assumed to share the same interests or goals?
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            While these questions are all addressed in part by other disciplines
            (notably economics and social sciences), what makes the multi-agent
            systems field unique is that it emphasises that the agents in
            question are computational, information processing entities.
        </p>

        <h4>the interdisciplinary nature of multi-agent systems</h4>

        <p>
            The field of multi-agent systems is influenced and inspired by many
            other fields:

            <ul>
                <li>economics</li>
                <li>philosophy</li>
                <li>game theory</li>
                <li>logic</li>
                <li>ecology</li>
                <li>social sciences</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Being interdisciplinary led to well-founded methodologies being
            infused into the field.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, weaknesses arise as well, such as there being many
            different views as to what the field is about, and different
            researchers have different visions.
        </p>

        <h4>agents as a paradigm for software engineering</h4>

        <p>
            Software engineers have derived a progressively better understanding
            of the characteristics of complexity in software.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is now widely recognised that interaction is probably the most
            important single characteristic of complex software.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the last two decades, a major computer science research topic
            has been the development of tools and techniques to model,
            understand and implement systems in which interaction is the norm.
        </p>

        <h4>agents as a tool for understanding human societies</h4>

        <p>
            Multi-agent systems provide a novel new tool for simulating
            societies, which may help shed some light on various kinds of social
            processes.
        </p>

        <h4>differences in comparison to other fields</h4>

        <p>
            distributed / concurrent systems:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Agents are assumed to be autonomous, capable of making
                    independent decisions - so they need mechanisms to
                    synchronise and coordinate their activites at run time.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Agents are / can be self-interested, so their interactions
                    are 'economic' encounters.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            artificial intelligence:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    we do not need to solve all problems of artificial
                    intelligence in order to build really useful agents.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Classical artificial intelligence ignored social aspects of
                    agency; these are important parts of intelligent activity in
                    real-world settings.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            economics / game theory:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    insofar as game theory provides descriptive concepts, it
                    does not always tell us how to compute solutions - we are
                    concerned with computational, resource-bounded agents.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Some assumptions in economics / game theory (such as
                    rational agent) may not be valid in building artificial
                    agents.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            social science:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    We can draw insights from the study of human societies, but
                    there is no particular reason to believe that artificial
                    societies will be constructed in the same way.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>applications of individual agents</h4>

        <p>
            Individual / single agents are used in domains where autonomous
            action is required.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Agents (and their physical instantiation in robots) have a
                    role to play in high-risk situations that are unsuitable or
                    impossible for humans.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Agents, as personal software assistants, play the role of
                    proactive assistants to users working on some applications.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The degree of autonomy will differ depending on the situation -
            human intervention may be an alternative, but not always.
        </p>

        <h4>applications of multi-agent systems</h4>

        <p>
            Multi-agent systems are useful in domains where:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    control, data, expertise are distributed
                </li>

                <li>
                    centralised control is impossible or impractical
                </li>

                <li>
                    processing nodes have competing or conflicting viewpoints or objectives
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
