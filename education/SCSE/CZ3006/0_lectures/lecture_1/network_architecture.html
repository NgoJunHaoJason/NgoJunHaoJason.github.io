            Network Architecture
        </h3>

        <h4>motivations for layered network architecture</h4>

        <p>
            Networks are complex with many pieces: hosts, routers, links,
            applications, protocols, hardware, software.
        </p>

        <p>
            As such, there is a need to decompose the network into several
            layers.
        </p>

        <p>
            An explicit structure allows identification of different pieces and
            relationships between different pieces.
        </p>

        <p>
            Modularisation of the network eases maintenance and updating.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    changes of a layer's service is transparent to the rest of
                    the system
                </li>

                <li>
                    change in network technology does not affect the rest of the
                    system
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>benefits of layered architecture</h4>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    simplicity - Network is easy to design once layers and their
                    interactions are defined clearly.
                </li>

                <li>
                    flexibity - It is easy to modify and develop networks by
                    modifying layers separately.
                </li>

                <li>
                    incremental changes - It is easy to add new layers and easy
                    to add new functions to a layer.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>disadvantages of layered architecture</h4>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    need to maintain different layers
                </li>

                <li>
                    incur additional overhead
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>layered network architecture</h4>

        <p>
            The network architecture defines specifications of layers and
            protocols.
        </p>

        <p>
            The network is organised as a stack of layers, with each layer
            offering its services to the layer above it and passing data and
            control to the layer below, using a well-defined interface.
        </p>

        <p>
            The protocols form a set of rules which govern communication between
            network entities. They define format, order of messages sent and
            received among network entities, and actions taken upon message
            transmission and receipt.
        </p>

        <h4>OSI 7-layer model</h4>

        <table class="table">
            <tr><td>application</td></tr>
            <tr><td>presentation</td></tr>
            <tr><td>session</td></tr>
            <tr><td>transport</td></tr>
            <tr><td>network</td></tr>
            <tr><td>data link</td></tr>
            <tr><td>physical</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            The Open System Interconnection 7-layer model is a functional
            decomposition of the network. Only peer (adjacent) layers
            communicate with each other, with each layer adding / removing
            headers.
        </p>

        <h4>OSI in action</h4>

        <p>
            A message begins at the top (application layer) and moves down the
            OSI layers to the bottom (physical) layer.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the message descends, each successive layer adds a header to it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The header is header-specific information that explains what
            functions the layer carries out.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the receiving end, headers are stripped from the message as it
            travels up the OSI layers.
        </p>

        <h4>OSI protocols</h4>

        <p>
            Layer <i>n</i> in one machine interacts with layer <i>n</i> in
            another machine to provide a service to layer <i>n</i> + 1.
        </p>

        <p>
            The entities comprising the corresponding layers on different
            machines are called peer processes.
        </p>

        <p>
            The machines use a set of rules and conventions called the layer
            <i>n</i> protocol.
        </p>

        <p>
            Layer <i>n</i> peer processes communicate by exchanging Protocol
            Data Units.
        </p>

        <h4>OSI services</h4>

        <p>
            Communication between peer processes is virtual and indirect.
        </p>

        <p>
            Layer <i>n</i> + 1 transfers information by invoking the services
            provided by layer <i>n</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Services are available at Service Access Points.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each layer passes data and control information to the layer below it
            until the physical layer is reached and transfer occurs.
        </p>

        <p>
            The data passed to the layer below it is called Service Data Unit.
            Service Data Units are encapsulated in Protocol Data Units.
        </p>

        <h4>TCP/IP model</h4>

        <table class="table">
            <tr><td>application</td></tr>
            <tr><td>transport</td></tr>
            <tr><td>network</td></tr>
            <tr><td>link</td></tr>
            <tr><td>physical</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            The Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol model has the
            same behaviour as the OSI model.
        </p>

        <p>
            The implementation of network architecture as a 5-layers model is a
            compromise between OSI model's 7 layers (easy to maintain, but too
            much overhead) and 1 layer (too complex to maintain).
